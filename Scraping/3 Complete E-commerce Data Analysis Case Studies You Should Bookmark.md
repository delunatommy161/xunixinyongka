# 3 Complete E-commerce Data Analysis Case Studies You Should Bookmark

In the e-commerce industry, data analysis plays a pivotal role in understanding consumer demand, optimizing marketing strategies, and enhancing user experience. This article showcases **three comprehensive e-commerce data analysis case studies** to help you improve your data analysis skills in the e-commerce sector.

## 1. Case Study: Identifying Stagnation in Sales Growth

### 1.1 Business Background and Requirements

As the market becomes increasingly saturated, competition intensifies, leading to a noticeable slowdown in sales growth for a particular e-commerce platform. To uncover the reasons behind this stagnation, sales data from 2015â€“2017 was analyzed. The objective was to identify the problem areas and provide actionable insights to improve the platform's operational strategies.

### 1.2 Data Sources

The data used for this analysis was sourced from the Heywhale Community ([Heywhale](https://www.heywhale.com/home)). The dataset includes:

- **Member Information Table**: Membership ID, age, and gender.
- **Sales Records Table**: Membership ID, order ID, customer group, purchase amount, sales quantity, sales price, brand, and transaction date.
- **Customer Unit Price Table**: Tracks changes in average purchase value.

### 1.3 Analytical Approach

To reduce noise from excessive data, only the highest sales months (Januaryâ€“March) for each year were analyzed. Sales growth primarily hinges on two factors: **increasing membership numbers** and **product performance**. Therefore, the analysis focused on:

- Membership growth trends and purchase frequency.
- Customer segmentation based on time, gender, and age to identify high-value demographics for targeted marketing.
- Product trends to adjust strategies and boost sales.

#### Key Steps:

1. Analyze membership data to understand growth trends and monthly purchase frequency. The analysis focused solely on the number of active customers, ignoring churn rates.
2. Segment customers by **time**, **gender**, and **age group** to evaluate unit price contribution and identify key target demographics.
3. Examine product performance to track recent trends and guide strategic adjustments.

### 1.4 Data Processing

The following steps were carried out for data preparation and processing:

- **Data Cleaning**: Handled using Power Query in Excel to clean and fill missing data in sales records and membership information tables.
- **Sales Aggregation**: Summed up sales for different time periods and calculated average unit prices.
- **Data Integration**: Combined membership information and sales records into a unified dataset for analysis.
