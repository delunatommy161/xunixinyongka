## Building a Walmart Product URL List

The first step in scraping Walmart is designing a web crawler to generate a list of product URLs. The easiest way to do this is by leveraging Walmart's **Search Page**, which displays **up to 40 products per page**.

### Using Walmart's Search Page

For instance, here's a sample search for **iPads**:

#### Key URL Parameters:
1. **`q`**: The search query (e.g., `q=ipad`). If your keyword includes spaces or special characters, ensure it's URL-encoded.
2. **`sort`**: Determines sorting order (e.g., `sort=best_seller`, `price_low`, or `price_high`).
3. **`page`**: Specifies the page number (e.g., `page=1`).

By customizing these parameters, you can extract multiple product URLs.

---

### Limitations: Walmart's 25-Page Cap

Walmart caps search results at 25 pages. To get around this, try:
- **More Specific Queries**: Narrow searches (e.g., "iPhone 14" instead of "iPhone").
- **Different Sorting Options**: Use combinations like `price_low` and `price_high` to find unique results.

---

### Extracting Data via Hidden JSON

Walmart stores product data as **hidden JSON blobs** within the `<script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">` tag. Here's how to parse it:

1. Locate the JSON blob.
2. Parse the JSON to extract product names, prices, images, ratings, and more.

This method eliminates the need for CSS or XPath selectors and provides cleaner data.

## Scraping Walmart Product Pages

Once you have a list of product URLs, the next step is scraping each Walmart product page for detailed data.

### Why Walmart's JSON Makes It Easy

Similar to the search results, Walmart's product pages include structured data in the `<script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">` tag. This reduces the complexity of building CSS/XPath selectors and ensures clean, ready-to-use data.

#### Example Data:
Hereâ€™s a sample output of the data you can extract:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "4SR8VU90LQ0P",
    "type": "Tablet Computers",
    "name": "2021 Apple 10.2-inch iPad Wi-Fi 64GB - Space Gray (9th Generation)",
    "brand": "Apple",
    "averageRating": 4.7,
    "price": 299,
    "currencyUnit": "USD",
    "thumbnailUrl": "https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/86cda84e-4f55-4ffa-954e-9ca5ae27b723.8a72a9690e1951f535eed412cc9e5fc3.jpeg"
  }
]
```

### Additional Insights:
- **Product Reviews**: Reviews are also available within the JSON blob.
- **Selective Data Extraction**: Configure your scraper to only extract necessary fields, reducing processing time.

## Dealing with Walmart's Anti-Bot Protection

Walmart employs anti-bot measures, such as CAPTCHA challenges and redirects to its **[blocked page](https://www.walmart.com/blocked)**.

### Overcoming Anti-Bot Challenges
1. **Rotating Proxies**: Use multiple IP addresses to avoid detection.
2. **User-Agent Rotation**: Change browser headers to mimic real user behavior.
3. **Browser Profiles**: Fortify headless browsers to evade detection.
