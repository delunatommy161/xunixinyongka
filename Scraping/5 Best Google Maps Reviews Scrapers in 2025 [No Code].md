## Is Scraping Google Maps Reviews Legal?

Scraping public data (like Google Maps reviews) is generally legal. According to the Ninth Circuit ruling in the LinkedIn vs. Hiq Labs case, **publicly accessible data can be legally scraped**. However, you must comply with data protection laws such as GDPR when handling personal data.

### GDPR Compliance:
Here are four principles to follow when scraping reviews:
- **Purpose Limitation**: Only scrape data for legitimate purposes (e.g., monitoring your own business).
- **Data Minimization**: Extract only the data you need (e.g., review text, not user photos).
- **Storage Limitation**: Delete the data once you're done using it.
- **Security**: Protect your scraped data from unauthorized access.
