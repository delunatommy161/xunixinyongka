## How to Scrape Google Maps

This tutorial will demonstrate how to scrape Google Maps using a Node.js script. As an example, weâ€™ll extract data about bookshops in California, including:

- Name  
- Type  
- Description  
- Address  
- Phone number  
- Availability hours  
- Availability status  
- Average rating  
- Total reviews  
- Delivery options  
- Google Maps link  

Weâ€™ll also export the data in JSON format for easier processing.

## Tools Required

Before starting, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- **Node.js 18+ and NPM**: [Download here](https://nodejs.org/en/download)  
- Text editor of your choice (e.g., VSCode)

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Set Up the Project

First, create a folder for your scraper project:

```bash
mkdir google-maps-scraper
cd google-maps-scraper
npm init -y
```

Create an `index.js` file and add a basic JavaScript instruction:

```bash
touch index.js
echo "console.log('Hello world!');" > index.js
node index.js
```

This should print `Hello world!` in the terminal.

### 2. Install Dependencies

To scrape Google Maps, we need the following Node.js packages:

- **[Puppeteer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer)**: For loading the Google Maps website, interacting with the page, and downloading the HTML content.  
- **[Cheerio](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cheerio)**: For extracting information from the downloaded HTML.

Install these packages with:

```bash
npm install puppeteer cheerio
```

### 3. Identify DOM Selectors

Open [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps), search for "bookshop," and inspect the pageâ€™s HTML structure to identify the DOM selectors. These selectors will help us extract the required data, such as names, ratings, and addresses.

For example, the selector for business names might look like `.Nv2PK .qBF1Pd`.

### 4. Write the Scraping Code

Hereâ€™s a basic structure for your `index.js` file:

#### Load Puppeteer and Cheerio
```javascript
const puppeteer = require("puppeteer");
const cheerio = require("cheerio");

const waitFor = (timeInMs) => new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, timeInMs));
```

#### Launch the Browser and Navigate to Google Maps
```javascript
const main = async () => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch({ headless: false });
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  await page.setExtraHTTPHeaders({
    "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0",
  });

  await page.goto("https://www.google.com/maps/search/bookshop", {
    waitUntil: "domcontentloaded",
  });

  // Handle consent page (if present)
  const consentButton = await page.$('.VfPpkd-LgbsSe[aria-label="Reject all"]');
  await consentButton?.click();
  await waitFor(5000);
};
```

#### Scroll and Extract HTML Content
```javascript
const scrollSelector = ".m6QErb[aria-label]";
let scrollCount = 0;
const maxScrolls = 10;

while (scrollCount < maxScrolls) {
  await page.evaluate((selector) => {
    document.querySelector(selector).scrollTo(0, document.querySelector(selector).scrollHeight);
  }, scrollSelector);
  await waitFor(2000);
  scrollCount++;
}

const html = await page.content();
await browser.close();
console.log(html);
```

#### Extract Data Using Cheerio
```javascript
const extractPlacesInfo = (html) => {
  const $ = cheerio.load(html);
  const results = [];

  $(".Nv2PK").each((_, el) => {
    const title = $(el).find(".qBF1Pd").text();
    const rating = $(el).find(".MW4etd").text();
    const address = $(el).find(".W4Efsd").text();
    const link = $(el).find("a.hfpxzc").attr("href");

    results.push({ title, rating, address, link });
  });

  return results;
};

const result = extractPlacesInfo(html);
console.log(result);
```
