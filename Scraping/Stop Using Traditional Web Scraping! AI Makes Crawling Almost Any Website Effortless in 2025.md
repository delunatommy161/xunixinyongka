## Why AI Is Transforming Web Scraping

In the past, companies like Amazon or Walmart had to invest significant resources in developing and maintaining web scrapers. These scrapers simulated browser actions, sending requests to websites, extracting HTML, and parsing specific data. The process was cumbersome, especially when website designs changed, requiring constant updates to the scraper.

With AI and large language models (LLMs), web scraping is now simpler, faster, and more cost-effective. Tasks that used to take days or weeks can now be accomplished in hours. AI can intelligently interpret website structures, reducing the need for frequent maintenance and re-coding.

### Use Cases of AI-Powered Web Scraping

1. **Price Monitoring**: Startups can track competitor prices to adjust their own pricing strategies.
2. **Market Research**: Small businesses can gather customer insights without breaking the bank.
3. **Freelancing Projects**: Platforms like Upwork feature gigs for freelancers skilled in building scrapers to extract data for contact lists, price tracking, or job boards.

## Web Scraping Made Simple with AI Tools

I‚Äôve categorized websites into three levels based on complexity:

### 1. Scraping Simple Public Websites

Websites like Wikipedia or company homepages are straightforward to scrape. They don‚Äôt require login credentials or payment access. Previously, scraping Wikipedia meant manually inspecting HTML and writing custom code. Now, LLMs can process raw HTML and directly provide structured data. For example, you can request: *‚ÄúExtract plant names, descriptions, and care instructions,‚Äù* and the AI will return an organized dataset‚Äîsaving hours of effort.

### 2. Scraping Websites with Complex Interactions

Interactive websites requiring logins, CAPTCHA-solving, or pop-up handling‚Äîlike news sites‚Äîpose greater challenges. Tools like **Selenium**, **Puppeteer**, and **Playwright** automate these interactions. For instance:

- To scrape articles from *The New York Times*, you can use Playwright or Selenium to log in, close pop-ups, and navigate to articles.
- **AgentQL** helps identify essential page elements (e.g., buttons, forms) to streamline complex actions.

### 3. Advanced Applications Requiring Smart Agents

High-level tasks, like finding the cheapest flight or purchasing concert tickets within a budget, require advanced planning and decision-making. Tools like **Multion** enable autonomous agents to complete such complex tasks. For instance, it can search for the best flight from New York to Melbourne in July and even book it for you.
